      <description>The present paper explores the application of bootstrap methods in testing for serial dependence in observed driven Integer-AutoRegressive (models) considering Poisson arrivals (P-INAR). To this end, a new semiparametric and restricted bootstrap algorithm is developed to ameliorate the performance of the score-based test statistic, especially when the time series present small or moderately small lengths. The performance of the proposed bootstrap test, in terms of empirical size and power, is investigated through a simulation study even considering deviation from Poisson assumptions for innovations, i.</description>

      <description>This work exploits the potential of bootstrap methods in testing for serial dependence in the class of observed driven Integer-AutoRegressive (INAR) models with Poisson innovations. The main contribution is to develop a novel restricted bootstrap algorithm to improve the performance of score-based test statistic, especially in case of moderately small series.</description>
