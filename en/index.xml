      <description>This is the first post of a series intented to present an overview of the steps involved in undertaking text and data mining. Here, the first pre-processing steps of textual data mining are introduced.
Questo post è un estratto del seminario online che si è tenuto nell’ambito della Scuola Estiva per il Piano di Lauree Scientifiche (PLS) (in inglese metti Plan for Science Degrees) promulgato dall’Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II.</description>

      <description>DESPOTA (DEndogram Slicing through a PermutatiOn Test Approach) is a novel approach exploiting permutation tests in order to automatically detect a partition among those embedded in a dendrogram. Unlike the traditional approach, DESPOTA includes in the search space also partitions not corresponding to horizontal cuts of the dendrogram.
The output of hierarchical clustering methods is typically displayed as a dendrogram describing a family of nested partitions. However, the exploitable partitions are usually restricted to those relying on horizontal cuts of the tree, missing the possibility to explore the whole set of partitions housed in the dendrogram.</description>

      <title>Local clustering coefficient to measure intra-regional tourism in Italy</title>

      <description>Network analysis represents a useful approach to measure intra-regional tourism flows. Relevant information about this phenomenon can be retrieved using Network Analysis local clustering coefficient (LCC). In this work we study Italian tourism flows in two-year period 2018-2019, identifying different patterns and two main groups of regions. This preliminary study shows the potential of LCCs to evaluate the effects of tourism policies in terms of attractiveness and receptivity of a region (or groups of regions).</description>

      <title>Searching for the determinants of new social enterprises: the case of Italian social start-ups</title>

      <description>Social start-ups constitute a subclass of the innovative entrepreneurship market and they are a relatively new topic in the literature from both the scientific and normative perspectives. In Italy, a start-up can be registered as social-oriented innovative startup (SIAVS), after demonstrating its ability to make social impacts and satisfy a set of normative requirements. This paper describes and models (at the territorial level) the presence of these innovative companies focused on social, cultural, and/or environmental needs.</description>

The present work is part of the &amp;ldquo;Plan for Science Degrees&amp;rdquo; (Piano Lauree Scientifiche, PLS), aiming at presenting and discussing the potential of the analysis of complex data to high school seniors and university freshmen. In particular, the focus has been on the analysis of textual data, a field that has seen an exponential development in recent years, also from the spread and relevance assumed by social media and social networks.</description>

      <title>Southern Italian Peripheries at the Ballot Box. Continuity and Innovation in Electoral Behaviours in Three Southern Italian Cities during Post-Crisis Decade (2008-2019)</title>

      <description>The article explores the social and political geography of three southern Italian cities - Bari, Napoli and Reggio Calabria - and investigates inside their centre-periphery cleavage, highlighting whether and how peripheral conditions affect electoral behaviours. It provides a multidimensional statistical analysis based on I.S.T.A.T. data on Italian cities and suburbs and on the results of the political and European elections during the post-economic crisis decade (2008-2019). The study highlights a growing predictive power, after the 2008 crisis, of the peripheral condition on the electoral behaviour, the weakening of the centre-left parties and the specular political success of 5-Star Movement (M5S) in deprived urban areas.</description>

      <description>Passes are undoubtedly the more frequent events in football and other team sports. Passing networks and their structural features can be useful to evaluate the style of play in terms of passing behavior, analyzing and quantifying interactions among players. The present paper aims to show how information retrieved from passing networks can have a relevant impact on predicting the match outcome. In particular, we focus on modeling both the scored goals by two competing teams and the goal diference between them.</description>

      <description>Summary statistics for football matches, such as ball possession and percentage of completed passes, are not always satisfyingly informative about team strategies seen on the pitch. Passing networks and their structural features can be used to evaluate the style of play in terms of passing behavior, analyzing and quantifying interactions among players. The aim of the present paper is to show how information retrieved from passing networks can have a significant impact on the match outcome.</description>

      <description>The Nea-Statistic (NeaS) blog is intended to be a virtual meeting place where people can read about statistics and share new findings in data science. We plan to introduce students (and also a broader audience) some current topics in Data Science, while also making some of our research interests visible to the general public.
Our hope is to create a cozy corner where we can share observations and disseminate ideas with an international community informally, without the pressure of the peer review process.</description>

      <description>This work exploits the potential of bootstrap methods in testing for serial dependence in the class of observed driven Integer-AutoRegressive (INAR) models with Poisson innovations. The main contribution is to develop a novel restricted bootstrap algorithm to improve the performance of score-based test statistic, especially in case of moderately small series.</description>

In this article we analyze the performance of the Italian healthcare system during the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The aim of this work is to investigate the presence of health imbalances (if any) at a territorial level, identifying common features in terms of virus incidence. This analysis is carried out through a comparison of the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances of the historical series relating to admissions to intensive care units and hospitalzed patients for the 19 Italian regions and the two autonomous provinces of Trento and Bolzano.</description>

      <description>Recently, the interest of the academic literature on sports statistics has increased enormously. In such a framework, two of the most significant challenges are developing a model able to beat the existing approaches and, within a betting market framework, guarantee superior returns than the set of competing specifications considered. This contribution attempts to achieve both these results, in the context of male tennis. In tennis, several approaches to predict the winner are available, among which the regression-based, point-based and paired comparison of the competitors&#39; abilities play a significant role.</description>

In this paper we identify the relationships between the Italian university courses and students&#39; first job categories. University courses in Italy are divided in bachelor (corsi di studio, CdS) and master degrees (corsi di laurea,CdL), while the professional sectors are categorized by the ATECO codes, officially introduced by the Italian institute of statistics (ISTAT).</description>

      <description>ETC3550: Applied Forecasting for Business and Economics Reliable forecasts of business and economic variables must often be obtained against a backdrop of structural change in markets and the economy. This unit introduces methods suitable for forecasting in these circumstances including the decomposition of time series, exponential smoothing methods, ARIMA modelling, and regression with auto-correlated disturbances. Students can expect to enhance their computer skills with exercises using R.
